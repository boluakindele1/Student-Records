# Student-Records


1.	Create a text file containing a series of records  where each record consists of at least 4 values using String and numeric types along with others of your choosing.  These individual records could represent an object of your choice (for example, an employee, student, inventory etc.).
2.	Create a class for the purpose of representing a single record in your file and provide any necessary methods (accessors, mutators, constructors etc.).
3.	Write a class that will create an array of objects using the class you created in step 2.  
4.	Your main method will then enter a loop and display the following list of options to the user until the user chooses to exit your program by entering 8.
 
5.	Write the following methods so that, when the user selects an option, your program will respond as follows:
a.	when the user enters 1, your program will read input from your text file into an array of objects using an ArrayList.  In other words, your records are read from storage into memory.
b.	when the user enters 2, your program will ask the user what record they wish to view and will then display that record.  For this, you will want to create another method that will search on a particular field for the purpose of finding a specific record.  (for example, you could have your program search on ID, lastname etc.).  Once the record has been found, it is then displayed. 
c.	when the user enters 3, your program will display all records.
d.	when the user enters 4, your program will get the fields for a record from the user and create a new object to add to the array of records.
e.	when the user enters 5, your program will, again, search on a given criteria for the purpose of locating a specific record the user wishes to edit.  Your program will then ask the user which field they wish to edit and then make the change to the record accordingly.
f.	when the user enters 6, your program will, again, search on a given criteria for the purpose of locating a specific record the user wishes to delete.  Your program will then delete that record.
g.	when the user enters 7, your program will open your file back up and write all records to that file.   In other words, this method will save the changes to your array of records.
h.	When the user enters 8, your program jumps out of the loop and, rather than ending right away, asks the user if they wish to save their records before closing.
